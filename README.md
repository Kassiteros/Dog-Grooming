Dog Grooming

I am at the opening stages of creating a React site for a friend who is starting her own dog grooming business.

I plan to upload from a local repository to GitHub and then deploy in Netlify so I can allow my friedn to view
the site as it develops and we can test and model ideas when we schedule remote meetings.
