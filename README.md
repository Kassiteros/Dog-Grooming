# Dog-Grooming
## Dog Grooming website in React

I am at the opening stages of creating a React site for a friend who is starting her own dog grooming business.

I plan to upload from a local repository to GitHub and then deploy in Netlify so I can allow my friend to view
the site as it develops and we can test and model ideas whenever we can schedule remote meetings.

My initial throughts are to include a button to refresh a feed from https://dogapi.dog/api/v2/facts just so users
are immediately attracted to interact with the page. I also plan to have a contact / subscription form which 
appears from a button click, a separate module, and which will email a form to the specified email address so that
my friend, my customer effectively, can model the form contents with me and see the form arrive at any prescribed
email address she chooses.

I also plan to use React Router to create a single-page application (SPA) !

That's the intention... now, I need to make it happen ;-)
